# Tante Emmas Online Shop

This project is an example legacy code project.



Note that there are multiple branches:

* master contains all resources for a tutorial on analyzing the code with [testrecorder](http://testrecorder.amygdalum.net/)
  * find the resources in the directory [hints](https://github.com/almondtools/tante-emmas/tree/master/src/hints)
  * it lasts approximately 100 minutes
  * the lessons are found in `lessons.md` (build it with reveal-md as described in `build.md`)
  * the slides for presentation are in `slides.md` (and contain mostly the same content as `lessons.md`)
  * additionally you will find launch scripts for IntelliJ and Eclipse
* demo_xp2017 is the version presented at the workshop Record-Refactor-Replay at XP-Days 2017

The branch master will be probably updated if new lessons get available.
