# Get Familiar
## 10 min

* Start the launchscript
  * eclipse: TanteEmmas.launch
  * intellij: tante_emmas.xml -> .idea/runConfigurations
  * other: 

```Bash
java -cp [classpath] net.amygdalum.tanteemmas.server.Server
```

* Browse to http://localhost:8080
* Navigate through the application
* Explore the source code
 

----

## And now some hints:

* Stop the previous server (Vert.x) before starting a new server (you will possibly not recognize that you run on an old server session)
* Save all tests you want to keep. Each recorder session will replace existing files
* Delete all tests before starting a new server. Otherwise you cannot distinguish old recorded and new recorded files
* Read the javadocs for the used annotations. They will give you further hints on how to accomplish succesful recordings
* Do not rely on few tests, about 100 tests will produce an acceptable coverage

# Install Testrecorder 
## 10 min

* Put testrecorder-0.3.12-jar-with-dependencies.jar in your workspace
* Put `AgentConfig.java` (located in src/hints) in the package `net.amygdalum.tanteemmas.testrecorder` in your src/main/java folder 
* Try to understand the configuration in `AgentConfig.java`

----

* Modify the launch script by adding  

```Bash
-javaagent:testrecorder-0.3.12-jar-with-dependencies.jar=net.amygdalum.tanteemmas.testrecorder.AgentConfig
```

  * eclipse: run configurations -> TanteEmmas -> Arguments -> Vm Arguments
  * intellij: run -> edit configurations -> tante-emmas -> Vm Options
  * shell: 

```Bash
java
  -cp [classpath]
  -javaagent:testrecorder-0.3.12-jar-with-dependencies.jar=net.amygdalum.tanteemmas.testrecorder.AgentConfig
  net.amygdalum.tanteemmas.server.Server
```

----

* Start the launch script
  * if the message `loading AgentConfig` appears => everything ok
  * else if the message `loading default config` appears => agent has been loaded but configuration not found (maybe AgentConfig is not in the correct package or the run script references a different config)
  * else => agent has not been loaded => adjust the path to the testrecorder.jar
* Stop the application

# Record Simple Methods 
## 15 min

* Annotate `PriceCalculator.computeFairPrice` with `@Recorded`
* Start the launch script, the messages should be:
  ```Bash
  loading AgentConfig`
  recording snapshots of ...
  ```

----

* Browse to http://localhost:8080  
* Navigate through the application
* Watch the console for generated tests
* Stop the server and examine the generated tests in the workspace target folder

----

* Try out different customer names such as:
  * Michaela Mustermann
  * Otto Normalverbraucher
  * Armer Schlucker
  * Reicher Schn√∂sel
  * Reicher Pinkel
  * Gerd Grosskunde
* Analyze the generated tests for the customers and see how testrecorder analysis tries to generate readable tests

----

* If you are finished
  * You may even add a customer in `CustomerRepo` to see how testrecorder generates tests for it
  * Feel free to add some new properties and explore how flexible testrecorder will adjust code generation

# Global Dependencies 
## 10 min

* Annotate `PriceCalculator.applyUnfairCharges` with `@Recorded`
* Start the launch script, the messages should be:
  ```Bash
  loading AgentConfig
  recording snapshots of ...
  ```

----

* Browse to http://localhost:8080
* Navigate through the application
* Watch the console for generated tests
* Stop the server and examine the generated tests in the workspace target folder

----

* <div class="tests-red">Unfortunately - the tests fail</div>
* But the productive code did work properly
* Analyze the test and the source code, what did we miss to record?

----

* The missing part is global state stored in static variables
* There are two ways to give testrecorder a hint which global state should be recorded
  * Annotate the static variable with `@Global`
  * Or adjust the `AgentConfig`s method `getGlobals`
* So find the static variable and tag it as global

----

* Start the launch script and browse to http://localhost:8080
* While navigating through the application watch the generated tests
* <div class="tests-green">The tests should work</div>

---

# Input Dependencies 
## 15 min

* Annotate `PriceCalculator.computePrice` with `@Recorded`
* Start the launch script, the messages should be:
  ```Bash
  loading AgentConfig
  recording snapshots of ...
  ```

----

* Browse to http://localhost:8080
* Navigate through the application
* Use fast motion and generate at least 100 tests
* Examine the tests

----

* <div class="tests-red">Unfortunately - some tests will fail</div>
* Analyze the test and the source code, what did we miss to record?

----

* The missing part is input
* As you learned testrecorder stores the state before and after execution of the recorded method
* Sometimes a method does not only depend on state in the JVM but state originating from external systems, e.g.
  * time
  * random
  * reading files (that could have been edited)
  * reading from web services
  * ...

----

* Since input sources are external to the JVM the only option to include input is to mock it
* There are two ways to give testrecorder a hint which methods provide input and have to be mocked
  * Annotate the input methods with `@Input`
  * Or adjust the `AgentConfig`s method `getInputs`
  * Note that each argument and each result of a tagged method is recorded and replayed later on
* So find the input method and tag it

----

* Start the launch script and browse to http://localhost:8080
* While navigating through the application watch the generated tests
* <div class="tests-green">The tests should work, if not - maybe there is more than one input</div>

---

# Output Dependencies 
## 15 min

* Annotate `PriceCalculator.order` with `@Recorded`
* Start the launch script, the messages should be:
  ```Bash
  loading AgentConfig
  recording snapshots of ...
  ```

----

* Browse to http://localhost:8080
* Navigate through the application and order some products
* Examine the generated tests

----

* <div class="tests-green">The tests are green</div>
* Change the timestamp argument in some of your tests

----

* <div class="tests-green">Astonishingly the tests stay green</div>
* You see: This green state is treacherous
* Analyze what the recorded method does and analyze which aspects of the method were not recorded

----

* The missing part is output
* As you learned testrecorder captures the state before and after execution of the recorded method
* Sometimes a method writes state to external systems, e.g.
  * writing files (that could have been edited)
  * requesting user input
  * notifying web services
  * ...

----

* Since output sinks are external to the JVM the only option to include output is to mock it and to verify the outputs
* There are two ways to give testrecorder a hint which methods consume output and have to be mocked
  * Annotate the output methods with `@Output`
  * Or adjust the `AgentConfig`s method `getOutputs`
  * Note that each argument of a tagged method is recorded and verified later on
* So find the output method and tag it

----

* Start the launch script and browse to http://localhost:8080
* While navigating through the application watch the generated tests
* <div class="tests-green">The tests should work</div>
* Now again change the timestamp argument of the tested method
* <div class="tests-red">The tests should turn red</div>

# Fix Bug
## 15 min

* maybe you have already found some nasty parts of the code
  * the customer/tester feels that a single rainy day increases the average price of all products for all time after
  * a tester mentioned that some event seems to modify the properties of all products
* find the variable that represents the product
* find changes to the product that correspond to the customers/testers experiences

----

* now we fix this bug test-driven
  * correct the tests that expect a behavior that is not expected by the customer/tester
  * <div class="tests-red">these tests should turn red</div>
  * then fix the code
  * <div class="tests-green">these tests should turn green</div>

----

* for sure - execute the other tests in your generated suite
  * <div class="tests-green">if you worked truely diligent (or your test suite was quite small) all tests are green</div>
  * <div class="tests-red">otherwise assume that you did work rather effective than diligent - but try to explain why other test do fail now</div>
